used for file/object based.

up to 5tb file size

unlimited storage

bucket == folder with universal namesapce

has a default url of https://s3-<zone>.amazonaws.com/...

read after write consistency == u can read right after writing a new object. overwriting an object and deletes can take time to propagate.


the different s3 classes - s3, IA, reduced redundancy storage (rrs) ,glacier

each object has: key, value, version id, metadata, access control list

not suitable for OS.

versioning - good for backups (watermark deletes). can't be turned off, only suspended.

lifecycle managment - can also be applied to versions.

----------------

edge location - seperate from AZ / regions

origin -  can be S3 bucket, EC2, ELASTIC LOAD BALANCER OR ROUTE 53

distribution - the name of the cdn. is a group of edge locations.
	web / rtmp (media)
edge location can also write files to origin

objects are cahced for TTL

clearing cache objects costs a charge.

------------------
objects / buckets a are default private.
access to buckets using bucket policies /access control list
buckets can log all activity. can also log into buckets.

encryption - 
in transit: ssl/tls

at rest: 
server side encryption:
 S3 managed keys - SSE-S3. uniqe key
aws key managment service (kms) SSE-KMS.
server side encryption with customer provided keys - SSE-C
client side encryption

------------------
file gateway - for flat files on S3
Volume gateway:
	stored volumes
	cached volumes
gateway virtual tapes library

-----------------------
snowball / snowball edge / snowmobile

used to be an import/export service

------------
tranfer acceleration. speed up transfer to S3

-----------
host static websites. very cheap and scales automaticaly 

------------
http code 200 on succesfull S3 upload
multipart upload is faster
