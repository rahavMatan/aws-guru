(optional - create a route 53 dns)
 created a role for S3 
 created 2 security groups for webAccess and RDS access
 created EBS 
 created 2 buckets. 1 for code and 1 for media assets.
 created a cloudfront instance
 created RDS instance
(optional-point the route53 dns to the ELB instance)
setting up EC2 instances 
ELB -> target groups ->targets ->add the Ec2 server instance
enter the ELB dns and configure the Wordpress site
in the db url paste in the RDS endpoint
aws s3 cp --recursive /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads s3://acg-assets-2 (this copies the uploads dir to our assets bucket)
aws s3 sync --delete /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads s3://acg-assets-2 --dryrun 
this syncs between the folder and the bucket. dry run is for runnig the command without actually changing the files. we will remove dryrun and run the command again. this does not execute automatically.

wget https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru-wp/htaccess   -downloads a file that configures the use of the cloudfront instead of the bucket dns.
mv htaccess .htaccess
nano .htaccess -> change to my cloudfront dns
save
cd /etc -> nano crontab   -crontab is for scheduling tasks.
add:
 */5 * * * * root aws s3 sync --delete /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads <our assets bucket>
 */5 * * * * root aws s3 sync --delete /var/www/html  <our code bucket>
these tasks will sync the folders with the buckets every 5 min.

load balancers -> target groups -> edit -> remove the ec2 instance -> save
create a new ELB  for writing -> add the ec2 instance 
Ec2 -> stop the ec2 instance 
(if using route53) route53 -> hosted zones -> create record set ->name:write.acouldguru.com, alias: yes, alias target: the new ELB
go back to EC2 -> make an image of the stopped EC2 instance
start the stopped EC2 instance
