tasks are invocations of steps in an app. not neccerasly performed by EC2 instances, but can also be human performed tasks 

has a retention period of up to a year.

*if it's less then 14 days it's better to use sws.

task oriented instead of message oriented.

tasks are delivered only once.

swf keeps track of all tasks en events. with sqs you need to implement application level tracking.
