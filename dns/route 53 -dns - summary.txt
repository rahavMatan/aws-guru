DNS (domain name system) - is used to convert domain names to internet protocol adress (ip).

ip6 is newer to ip4, and uses 128 bit adress instead of 32 bits.
the internet assigend numbers authority (iana) controlls the top level domain name (.com,.gov .co.uk .. )

domain registrars - authority for registering domain names.

Start of Authority (SOA) records - holds information about:
name of the server that supplied the data for the zone, the admin of the zone, the current version of the data file,  TTL for records.

NS (namer server) records - which name servers are in charge of the zone / domain

A (adress) records - the A records is used by a computer to translate the domain name to IP adress.

TTL (time to live) record - how long the name/ip adress is cached for in the browser / server

CNAMES - canonical name. can used for a domain to point to another. mobile.acg.com -> acg.com

Alias Records - used by aws like Cnames. but also can be used for 'naked domains names' http://acg.com
using an Alias is free, but CNAME is not.
**Alias is prefferd.

ELBs dont have an ipv4 adress, you resolve to them using a DNS name.

Route 53 policies:
simple - default, one server per on website

weighted - send a percentage of requests between 2 specified resources. can be used for A/B testing different versions of a website. or manual load balancing.

latency - base the routing on the lowest network latency. (which region will give the fastset response)

failover - used for an active/passive setup. if the primary server fails a health check, then the request is redirected to the secondary location

geolocation - route traffic depending on the location of the users.
