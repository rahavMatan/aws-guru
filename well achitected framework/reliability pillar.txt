covers the ability of a system to recover from and outage/distruption as well as the ability to dynamically acquire reousrces to meet demand

design principals:
-test your recovery procedure
-auto recover from failure
-scale horizontally - replace big resources with other smaller resources. distributing so no common point of failure.
-stop guessing capacity


foundations: before archtecting a system sure you have the foundations

foundations questions: 
-how are you managing your AWS service limits for your account?
-how are you plannig your network topology?
- do you have an esclation plan to deal with technichal issues?


change managment best practices: be aware of how change affects your system. plan proactivly around it.
use monitoring to automate response to changes.

change managment questions:
-how does your system adapt to change in demand?
-how are you monitoring AWS resources?
-how are you executing change managment?

failure managment best practices:
-always architect our system with the assumption that failure will accure, and how to respond.

faliure managment questions:
-how are you backing up your data?
- how does your system withstand a component faiure?
- how are you plannig for recovery?

 AWS services:
foundation: IAM, VPC

change managment: AWS cloudtrail

failure managment: cloud formation, multi AZ

exam tips:
reliability: foundation, change mangment, failure anagment, related questions.
