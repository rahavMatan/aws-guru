focuses on how to use resources efficiently to meet requirements, and maintainas demand changes and thechnology evolves.

design pricipals:
-democratize advanced technologies - use of newer srvices like nosql, Machine learning etc
-go global in minutes
-use serverless 
-experiment more often

defenition:

compute:
compute best practices: choose the right type of server / serverless
compute question:
-how do you select the appropriate instance for your system?
-how do you ensure that you continue to have the most appropriate instace type as new features are released?
-how do you monitor your instances after they launch?
-how do you ensure the quantity of instances matches demand?
---------------

storage
storage best practices:
access methods-block /file/object
pattern of access - random / sequence
throughput required
access frequency
update frequency
availability 
durability

storage best practices:
AWS storage is virtualized.
S3 has 11 9's durability.
cross region replication.
EBS mediums SSd,magnetic,PIOPS
move volumes between different storage types

storage questions:
-how do you select the best storage solution?
-how do you ensure that you continue to use the best storage solution?
-how do you monitor storage is performing as expected?
-how do you ensure capacity and IO demand is met?

----------------

DB

DB best practices: do you need DB consistency? high avaiability? noSQL? 



----------------
space-time tradeoff
best practices: using RDS read replicas, direct connect, CDN, elasticache
questions: 
-how do you select the appropriate proximity and caching solutions ?
-how do you monitor performace?

key service: autoscaling, storage options, DB  options, space-time options
