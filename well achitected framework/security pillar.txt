a set of questions you can use to evaluate how well your achitecture is aligned with AWS best practices

5 pillars:
---------------------------
1. Security:
design principal 
- apply security at all layers.
-enable traceability
-automate response to security events
-focus on securing your system (customer responsibilty vs AWS responsibility)
-automate security best practices (example: harden the OS of an AMI before deploying)

Security have 4 areas:
data protection,
privilege managment ,
infrastructure protection,
detective controls

data protection defenition:
data protection - basic data classification. organise and classify data into segments such as public, members only, certain members etc. implemet a least priviliged accesss system so people can only access what they need. and encrypt everything at rest and in transit.

data protection best practices:
 - customers maintain full control of their data.
- AWS offers encryption and key managment
- detailed logging 
- versioning can be part of a larger data lifecycle and protet against overwrites, deletes etc
- AWS never initiates data movement between regions

data protection questions:
-how are you encrypting and protecting data at rest?
- how are you encrypting and protecting data in transit (SSL)

priviliged managment best practices: ensure that only authorized and authenticated users access your rousurces and in the manner intended.
-Access control lists
- role based access control
-password managment (such as rotation policies)
 
priviliged managment questions:
-how are you protecting access to and use of AWS root acount credentials?
-how are you definig roles and responsebilities of system users to control human access to AWS managment console and Api?
-how are you limiting autoamted access(such from apps or scripts) to resources?
-how are you managing keys and credentials

infrastructure protection best practices: how you protect your data center outside of AWS.
-how to protect your VPC

infrastructure protection question:
-how are you enforcing network and host level boundry protection? 
-how are you enforcng AWS service level protection?
-how are you protecting the integrity of the OS in instances? (antivirus etc..)

detective control best practices:
to detect a security breach use:
cloudtrail
cloudwatch
AWS config
S3
Glacier
 detective contorol questions:
-how are you capturing AWS logs?



Security AWS services:
-encryption using ELB,EBS,S3,RDS
-proviliages: IAM, MFA
-infrastructure: VPC
detective controls: ckoudtrial, config cloudwatch

-----------------

Reliabilty

Perfiormace efficiency

Cost optimisitaion

Operational excellence



for each pillar:
design principal
defenition
best practices
key AWS services

-------------------

general design principals:
stop guessing your capacity needs
test system at production scale
automate to make experimentaion easier
allow for evolutionary achhitectures
data driven architucures 
improve thourgh game day (simulate a scenario like black friday)
