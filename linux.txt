terminal syntax: <username>@<host or computer name> : ~ == your directory

-pwd: print working directory. what dir I'm in

-cat : read a file
-ls: list of folder content. -l adds info about content. -a shows also hidden, or .(dot)files. can be used together: ls -la

dot files are hidden for a reason. 

-clear: clear screen.

cd: change directory , or move back to /home

.. : move up one dir

mkdir: make direcrory <name>

rmdir: remove directory

touch: create a file if it doesn't exist.
rm <name>: remove a file

cp <filename> <copyname>: copy a  file

mv <file><path/newfilename>: move a file or rename a file. (it deletes the origianl)


grep: pattern match.<searchparam> <filename>: displays the line where the word was found in the file.

diff <file1><file2>: print the lines that are different.

passwd : change your current user password

echo: display on the screen.

creating variables: <varname> = <value>.

echo $<varname>

info <command-name> : info about the command

saving results to a file: <command> > <filename>. overwrites existing content on file.

<command> >> <filename>. appends the results instead of overwrite

------------------------------

permissions: 
- : file
d : directory
r/w/x : read, write, execute
the three rwx groups: 
-the first is the permissoins of the OWNER of the file.
-the second is for the GROUP
-the third is for EVERYONE ELSE (global users).

permission groups: u-user, g-groups, o-outsideworld.

chmod <permmison group><add or remove +/-><permission name>:change permmisons on a file

shortcuts:
chmod <code>

7 - 1+2+4 (permissions)
6 - 4+2 (permissons)
5 - 4+1
4 - read
2 - write
1 - execute
0 - no permmissions

example: chmod 754 <filename> == user gets all prevliges, group get read and execute prevliges, others get read permissions.

---------------------

checksum : sha1sum <filename>. gives back a hash representing the file. 

------------------
** the '\' represents that the space should not be considered a seperation between COMMANDS. example: a file name called 'grocery list'. to acccess that file from the terminal : 'grocery\ list'

-------------
tar and gz files
gzip grocery\ list : will zip the file 
gunzip filename.gz : unzip

tar cvf <filename>.tar <file or files>: 
c: create or compress,
v: display in terminal
f: file options with params.

tar xvf
